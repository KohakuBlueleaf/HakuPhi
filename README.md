# Haku-Phi: A Phi playground
###### `Haku - ÁèÄ`
Original model: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-1_5

## What is this repo
Just a playground to place lot of things about phi. Maybe trainer/inference ui/optimizations/some addon archs...etc

## Plans:
- [x] optimizations: like xformers/pytorch sdp attn
- [ ] trainer: trainer for LLM/VQA/Image Captioner
- [ ] inference ui: Like what I have done on [Guanaco-7B](https://huggingface.co/JosephusCheung/Guanaco) (not the Q-LoRA one).
- [ ] some addon archs: For VQA or t2i model.
